## What is PLTW Engineering?

**Project Lead The Way (PLTW) Engineering** is a nationally recognized high school curriculum that introduces students to the scope, rigor, and discipline of engineering before college. The program integrates science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) to solve complex, open-ended problems in real-world contexts. Students engage in hands-on, project-based learning, using industry-leading technology and software just like professional engineers.

## Course Sequence

Our PLTW Engineering pathway includes the following courses:

- **Introduction to Engineering Design (IED):**  
  Students learn the engineering design process, apply math and science to hands-on projects, and use 3D modeling software to create solutions. Emphasis is placed on teamwork, problem-solving, and documenting work in engineering notebooks.

- **Principles of Engineering (POE):**  
  This course explores a broad range of engineering topics, including mechanisms, the strength of structures and materials, and automation. Students develop research, design, and collaboration skills while tackling real-world challenges.

- **Digital Electronics (DE):**  
  Through hands-on activities, students learn about digital circuits, microcontroller programming, and electronic design. Projects include building clocks, calculators, and Arduino-based devices.

- **Engineering Design and Development (EDD) – Capstone:**  
  In this senior-year course, students work in teams to research, design, and build solutions to authentic engineering problems. They present their work to panels of practicing engineers, applying all the skills developed in previous courses.
